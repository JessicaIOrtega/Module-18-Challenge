  ## Description
  MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

  ## Usage
  You need to use Insomnia to check all the routes and add, update, and delete users/thoughts/friends/reactions.
  Here are some screenshots testing the routes
